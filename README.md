# Koriobots
Koriobots are **cable-driven robots** that can be **dynamically choreographed** to make things float through mid-air. 
The koriobot platform is an open source toolkit aimed at unlocking **more imaginative experiences in robotics**: it is designed so that artists, architects, and designers can bring their creativity to **blend digital experiences with physical spaces**.

## Overview
This reposity contains all the learning materials, fabrication files, BOMs, and software to create your own cable-driven robot systems. 

- See the [software](https://github.com/madelinegannon/koriobots/tree/main/software) directory for the koriobots server, third-party software templates, and example projects.
- See the [hardware](https://github.com/madelinegannon/koriobots/tree/main/hardware) to see the BOM and download 3D printable parts for making your own koriobots.
- See the [tutorials](https://github.com/madelinegannon/koriobots/tree/main/tutorials) directory to learn how to make and use koriobots.

## Motivations
Koriobots is intended as a functional, replicatable, and extensible reference design for professional-grade cable robots. The specified hardware strives to be more reliable _(and expensive)_ than DIY solutions, and more flexible, deployable _(and cheaper)_ than comparable industrial solutions. The control software is developed with interaction and performance at its core: it is extensible to external creative programming environments, and can be configured with automatic startup, homing, and shutdown for standalone art installations.

Cable-driven robots are the secret ingredient for many of the most magical and engaging kinetic installations of the past twenty years. Unfortunately, each artist group has had to build their own cable robots from scratch. By sharing this knowledge, we can spend less 
 time reinventing technical solutions, and more time on creative exploration.

Our hope is that this knowledge repository can mitigate many of the technical hurdles of working with cable robots, and help to spark new forms of creative inquiry with this special type of robotic system.

## Contributing
The goal of this open source project is to grow and support many more usecases and audiences for cable-driven robots. We invite any and all contributions that extend the hardware, software, and learning materials for koriobots. Here are a few requests:
- Hardware
  - Additional mechanical design options for the cable drum.
  - Additional mounting options.
  - Additional end-effectors.
  - Alternative sources and specifications for the BOM.
- Software
  - Support for non-Teknic motors.
  - Improved velocity and position controllers.
  - Additional templates for third-party software integrations.
  - Additional examples showcasing different use cases and learning concepts.
