# Koriobots
Koriobots are **cable-driven robots** that can be **dynamically choreographed** to make things float through mid-air. 
The koriobot platform is an open source toolkit aimed at unlocking **more imaginative experiences in robotics**: it is designed for artists, architects, and designers â€” so they can bring their creativity to **blend digital and physical spaces**.

## Overview
This reposity contains all the learning materials, fabrication files, BOMs, and software to create your own cable-driven robot systems. 

- See the [software](https://github.com/madelinegannon/koriobots/tree/main/software) directory for the backend koriobots server and third-party software templates.
- See the [hardware](https://github.com/madelinegannon/koriobots/tree/main/hardware) to see the BOM and download 3D printable parts for making your own koriobots.
- See the [tutorials](https://github.com/madelinegannon/koriobots/tree/main/tutorials) directory to learn how to make and use koriobots.
